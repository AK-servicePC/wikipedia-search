Wikipedia Search
================

This extension integrates Wikipedia searching capabilities into Chrome and Opera. You can type the word 'wiki' into the address bar, press space (or tab), and start typing the article you want to find. Live results are pulled from Wikipedia as you type. The search language is automatically detected, but you can change it manually to any of the 50+ languages that Wikipedia supports.

In addition to the address bar search, this extension also adds a 'Search in Wikipedia' option to the right-click menu when you select text on any page. If you have [Awesome New Tab Page](https://antp.co) installed, Wikipedia Search provides a widget you can use.
