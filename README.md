Wikipedia Search
================

This extension adds Wikipedia searching capabilities to web browsers. To perform a search, just type 'wiki' in your browser's address bar, then a space, then the name of the article you want. Live suggestions from Wikipedia are displayed as you type. You can also highlight any word or phrase on the web, and an option to search in Wikipedia will appear in the context menu.

Your device's language is used as the default for searches, but you can also change it to any of the 300+ languages supported by Wikipedia.
