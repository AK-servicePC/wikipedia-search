Wikipedia Search
================
This extension allows you to type in a topic, click enter on your keyboard, and the article will appear in a new tab. Numerous Wikipedia extensions are available on the Chrome web store, but only this one opens results in the desktop Wikipedia. It opens the full blown site and not the dummed-down mobile version. Instant access to the millions of articles of articles on Wikipedia.

You can aso select your language of choice from the Options page, with access to every language Wikipedia has to offer. Simply right click the Wikipedia button, select Options, select a language from the simple list, and click Save. After that, the next time you search it will send you to the Wikipedia site for the language you chose.

Wikipedia Search is free to use in any browser extension, but I would like a link somewhere linking back to this Github page.
