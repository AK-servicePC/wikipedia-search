Wikipedia Search
================
This extension allows you to type the word 'wiki' into your search bar, press the space key, and search for an article on Wikipedia. Instant access to the millions of articles of articles on Wikipedia.

You can aso select your language of choice from the Options page, with access to every language Wikipedia has to offer. Simply click the Chrome menu button, go to Tools > Extensions > Wikipedia Search > Options, select a language from the simple list, and click Save. After that, the next time you search it will send you to the Wikipedia site for the language you chose.

Wikipedia Search is free to use in any browser extension, but I would like a link somewhere linking back to this Github page.
