Wikipedia Search
================
This extension allows you to type the word 'wiki' into your browser's search bar, press the space key, and search for an article on Wikipedia. You can also select any word or phrase on the web, right-click, and search it in Wikipedia. If you have [Awesome New Tab Page](https://antp.co) installed, there's even a widget for that built-in. Instant access to the millions of articles of articles on Wikipedia.

If English isn't your main language, it's easy to change the language Wikipedia Search uses. Just go to the Settings page to switch to any of the 50+ languages Wikipedia supports.
