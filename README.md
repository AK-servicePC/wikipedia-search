Wikipedia Search Classic
================
Wikipedia Search Classic is now discontinued. The current version, v6.1, will be the last update.

Wikipedia Classic started as a fork of Wikipedia Search 4.1.1, for people who wanted to keep the older button search instead of the new integration with Chrome's search bar and right-click functionality that 5.0 and above included. Wikipedia Search Classic was released as a seperate extension alongside the launch of Wikipedia Search 5.0, and has continued to recieve bug fixes and minor features included in the main extension.

I recommend all users to switch to the main Wikipedia Search extension, which will continue to be supported into the forseeable future. The main extension also has new features never implemented into Classic, such as right-click search and HTTPS support.

If you are a developer, you are more than welcome to fork the GitHub repo and release your own extension based on this one.
