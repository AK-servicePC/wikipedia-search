        <h2>New ways to search</h2>
        <p>You may notice that the old W button is missing. <b>That's because you can now search straight from the search bar!</b></p>
        <p>Just type 'wiki', then a space, then the name of the article you want. Live suggestions from Wikipedia are automatically displayed as you type, and in the language you pick!</p>
        <p>In addition, you can now <b>right-click on any word or phrase on the web</b> and search it in Wikipedia instantly.</p>
