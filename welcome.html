		<h1>Welcome to Wikipedia Search 6.3.1!</h1>
		<article>
			<h2>What's New?</h2>
			<p><b>Wikipedia Integration:</b> Wikipedia Search now integrates more deeply with Wikipedia, with options to show a panel of options on Wikipedia article pages for quick access to settings, and even hiding the search bar.</p>
			<p><b>Reset options:</b> There is now a reset button in the settings, to...well...reset the settings.</p>
			<p><b>Under-the-hood improvements:</b> Wikipedia Search 6.3 continues a clean-up of the overall codebase.</p>
			<p><i>And a secret easter egg hidden in the code ;)</i></p>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>To search, just type 'wiki' in the address bar, then a space, then the name of the article you want. Live suggestions from Wikipedia are displayed as you type, and in your selected language.</p>
			<p>In addition, you can select any word or phrase on the web, right-click, and search it in Wikipedia instantly.</p>
			<p>It's easy to change the language Wikipedia Search uses. Just go to the Settings to change to any of the 50+ languages Wikipedia supports:</p>
			<section id="settings-buttons" class="buttons" style="display: block;">
				<a class="g-button g-button-submit" href="settings.html">Go to Settings</a>
