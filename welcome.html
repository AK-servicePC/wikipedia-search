            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>To search just type 'wiki' in Chrome's searchbar, then a space, then the name of the article you want. Live suggestions from Wikipedia are automatically displayed as you type, and in the language you pick!</p>
            <p>In addition, you can now <b>right-click on any word or phrase on the web</b> and search it in Wikipedia instantly.</p>
            <p>It's easy to change the language Wikipedia Search uses. Just go to the Settings to change to any of the 50+ languages Wikipedia supports:</p>

            <h2>Don't like the update?</h2>
            <p>Wikipedia Search works differently from older versions, and we fully understand that some people might like the search button better. That's why we took the older version, added some minor improvements from newer updates, and named it <b>Wikipedia Search Classic</b>.</p>
            <p>You can get Wikipedia Search Classic on the Chrome Web Store. You can even have it installed alongside the normal Wikipedia Search.</p>
            <p>Additionally, if you have any problems with Wikipedia Search we would love it if you submitted a support request at the link below, so we can reply to you and help in any way we can.</p>
